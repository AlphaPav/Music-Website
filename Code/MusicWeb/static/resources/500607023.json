There were thousands of them!\nHow do you choose just one?\nOne woman, one house,\none piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at,\none way to die.\nAll that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends.\nAren't you scared of just breaking apart\njust thinking about it, the enormity of living in it?\nI was born on this ship.\nThe world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time.\nAnd there were wishes here,\nbut never more than could fit on a ship,\nbetween prow and stern.\nYou played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite.\nI learned to live that way.\nLand\nis a ship too big for me.\nIt's a woman too beautiful.\nIt's a voyage too long. Perfume too strong.\nIt's music I don't know how to make.\nI can't get off this ship.\n\n"}
