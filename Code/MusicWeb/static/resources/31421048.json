Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two\nYeah, I, I know it's hard to remember\nThe people we used to be\nIt's even harder to picture\nThat you're not here next to me\nYou say it's too late to make it\nBut is it too late to try\nAnd in our time that you wasted\nAll of our bridges burned down\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it love\nBut even the sun sets in paradise\nI'm at a payphone trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two\nIf \"Happy Ever After\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairy tales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nOh, you turned your back on tomorrow\nCause you forgot yesterday\nI gave you my love to borrow\nBut you just gave it away\nYou can't expect me to be fine\nI don't expect you to care\nI know I've said it before\nBut all of our bridges burned down\nI've wasted my nights,\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it love\nBut even the sun sets in paradise\nI'm at a payphone trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two\nIf \"Happy Ever After\" did exist,\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairy tales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nIf \"Happy Ever After\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairy tales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nNow I'm at a payphone\nMan, f*ck that sh*t\nI'll be out spending all this money\nWhile you're sitting round wondering\nWhy it wasn't you who came up from nothing\nMade it from the bottom\nNow when you see me I'm stunning\nAnd all of my cars start with a push of a button\nTelling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it\nSwitch the number to my phone so you never could call it\nDon't need my name on my shirt you can tell it I'm ballin\nSwish, what a shame could have got picked\nHad a really good game but you missed your last shot\nSo you talk about who you see at the top\nOr what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for\nPhantom pulled up valet open doors\nWiz like go away, got what you was looking for\nNow it's me who they want, so you can go and take that little piece of sh*t with you\nIf \"Happy Ever After\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairy tales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nIf \"Happy Ever After\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairy tales are full of it\nOne more stupid love song, I'll be sick\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\nNow I'm at a payphone\n"}
